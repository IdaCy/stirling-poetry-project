Scotland is a place
Stirling is a town
it is beautiful
bridge with a clown
hill and land
castle and crown
rain drives some insane
green removes the pain
wallace is famous
haggis is delicious


majestic Forth flowing wide,
nature's artistry, a scenic guide.
mists that dance on Dumyat glen,
whispers of tales from way back when.

bagpipes hum, a haunting tune,
underneath the knowledge moon.
lawn blooms in greenish hue,
uni spirits, strong and true.
